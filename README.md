# peertube-cli

A CLI client for peertube

## Why?

JavaScript sucks and i'm not willing to enable it.

## How?

`./peertube-cli <search query>`

If search query is not given, `peertube-cli` will prompt an
interactive search.

## TODO

* Config file
* let user select video player (though config file)
* getopt for instance, and maybe video player :^)

## Bugs

Sure.
